I'm a hybrid coder begginer and somewhat experienced, I have created many projects and the one i'm working on is the biggest of them all.

Here is a small snippet of what this large project of mines is going to do in the future:

import keyboard
import os
import time
import pyautogui

j = open("my_file.py", 'w')

time.sleep(2)

j.writelines("import time\n\n")
j.writelines("import keyboard\n\n")
j.writelines("from tkinter import *\n\n")
j.writelines("import os\n\n")
j.writelines("import pyautogui\n\n")
j.writelines("while True:\n")
j.writelines("    time.sleep(2)\n")
j.writelines("    if pyautogui.keyDown('k') == True:\n")
j.writelines("        os.system.__call__('Start my_file.py')\n")
j.writelines("        print('hi')")
