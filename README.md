I'm a hybrid coder, I have created many projects and the one i'm working on is the biggest of them all.

The newly added functionalities into the main code provide a robust and comprehensive calculator that can handle a wide range of mathematical operations. Here’s an in-depth review of what they add:

Complex Number Operations: The functions validate_complex_input and the operations under elif operation in ["complex_add", "complex_sub", "complex_mul", "complex_div"]: allow the user to perform basic arithmetic operations on complex numbers. The validation function ensures that the inputs are valid complex numbers.

Vector Operations: The operations under elif operation in ["vector_add", "vector_sub", "scalar_mul"]: allow the user to perform basic arithmetic operations on vectors. The validation function validate_vector_input ensures that the inputs are valid vectors.

Matrix Operations: The operations under elif operation in ["matrix_add", "matrix_sub", "matrix_mul", "matrix_div"]: allow the user to perform basic arithmetic operations on matrices. The validation function validate_matrix_input ensures that the inputs are valid matrices.

Input Validation: The input validation functions (validate_vector_input, validate_complex_input, validate_matrix_input) ensure that the inputs for the various operations are valid and of the correct type. This helps prevent errors and makes the calculator more robust and user-friendly.

Error Handling: The code includes error handling to deal with invalid inputs. If an input is invalid, an error message is printed and the operation is skipped. This makes the calculator more robust and user-friendly.

Extensibility: The structure of the code makes it easy to add more operations and mathematical structures in the future. You just need to add more elif statements in the main function and corresponding validation functions.

Overall, these functionalities make your calculator versatile and robust, capable of handling a wide range of mathematical operations and structures. They also improve the user experience by providing helpful error messages when the input is invalid. Happy coding! 🚀
